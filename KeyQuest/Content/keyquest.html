    <h1>Welcome to KeyQuest!</h1>
    <p>You are King Mozilla of Winderos. An ancient curse is upon your lands, and to lift the curse you must recover three magical keys.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Control Key is guarded by the evil wizard Ballmerack
        </li>
        <li>
            The Alt key is guarded by the cleric Baliskov
        </li>
        <li>The Delete Key is guarded by the Earl of Ang</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>To complete your quest, you need to retrieve various magical items from the inhabitants of Winderos. Fortunately, all the inhabitants of Winderos speak HTTP+JSON.</p>
    <p>To interact with one of the characters, you need to make an HTTP POST to their endpoint. Some interactions require you to use a magical item, or offer them a piece of treasure.</p>
    <p>Here's how you would offer the Talisman of Optimisation to the cleric Baliskov:</p>
<pre>
POST /cleric HTTP/1.1
{ "name" : "Talisman of Optimisation" }
</pre>
    <p>If your encounter is successful, they'll return a 200 OK and include a magical item in JSON format. If your encounter is not successful, they'll return an HTTP error status and your quest is over.</p>
